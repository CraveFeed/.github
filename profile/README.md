### How Do We Ensure That the Uploaded Content Is Food/Travel Related Only?

We implement image recognition models such as YOLO object detection models, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

### How to Prevent NSFW Content on Our Application?

We will require policy changes to consider this. Some subreddits contain grotesque content that is part of the food industry. If we include them in our application to cater to a larger audience, we would need to separate NSFW content from the application or recommendations for the general audience. This can be implemented like a filter on Reddit, using flags to stop triggers.

We can implement an advanced sentiment analysis model on comments to prevent harassment.
